# Olist-Ecommerce-Data-Analysis
This is a data analysis project using the Olist Ecommerce Dataset, taking data from a Brazilian ecommerce company.

The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

When uploading the dataset into SQL, there were a lot of issues, thus some rows of data were not uploaded. The analysis is done based on the rows of data that were correctly imported so may not reflect the true nature of the dataset. As the purpose of the project was to use SQL to perform queries and derive useful information, the analysis does not take into regard the rows that failed to import.

To see my analysis of the data, please view the <b>analysis_report.pptx<b> file.
